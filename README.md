# Darice

Hcd is asignment of making an personal website for someone.

## Week 1 - Meeting Darice

Darice is an nice lady that poorly enough became deaf around 2006 and an day before an interview. The asignment that we got from her was eather make an transcript for an podcast called "the Bims" or make subtittles for the movie Odd Thomas.

After meeting with Darice I decided to look into the movie Odd Thomas for my assignment. Vasilis also shared his code how to do subtitltes for an youtube video so that makes it easier for me to start.

So for week two I want to mainly test moving subtittles or and screen. So I started with using an codepen to make example of how I want to use.

- First subtitle that is moving
- Than Subtittle with a moving object under it
- Subtitle box moving
- Screen moving

And also

- Rotating shaking
- Extremly fast almost teleporting shaking

I will be testing this next week.

## Week 2 - first test

This week I have tested the shaking and moving of the subtitles, box and etc. After some feedback the extremly fast shacking was instantly rejected. It made her feel sick for even looking at in 1 sec.

Also with the moving of the screen is not recommanded at all except if it is for 1 second. the first option the moving of the text is recommanded because of the of the simple use.

After this feedback I looked for an scene that I would like to give subtitles to. the scene had decided upon was the bus scene that ends in an explosion.

I gave the scene a screen shake for around 1 second and an growing text for an screaming monster. Showing this during the feedback. i got feedback that this scene was not nesserary for extra details and maybe a different scene has a lot sound you hear except you don't see them. 

Looking the new scene for next week.

## Week 3 - Showing current results and second test

Darice agreed the explosion scene was not scene that is recommended because of a simple reason. She can already see the explosion and so it not nessecary to make a "sound effect". So after that I shown the scene i shown her the second scene.

the church scene. This scene shows Odd in distres because an man he knows is dangerous appear. he start be trying to but the man suprisses Odd and Odd retrieves back into the church. You can hear the man outside an Odd react to it. But the sound can be scene because the man is still outside. This is why I want to try to make this the new scene. 

Darice agreed to it and showed her my work that already done. the text needs to be closer because she doesn't notice the text that well.

So I am gonna work on finishing the scene and make the subtittles more clear. and I have decided with this week result and previous week result to not use screen shake for the church scene since that it could ruin the tension.

## Week 4 - Final week testing the church scene

All the subtitltes are added and I decided to use the explosion effect for the footsteps, moving of objects and door lock sound effect and made them more subtle. And I made an fast moving wind effect. I purposely made it fast to test and see what the result is of the test.

---

after testing for the final time I got some interresting results. The first thing I was asked if the footstep sound effect are in the tempo of the sound I can hear and if I want to improve that I should try to match it.

Also that the wind sound effect was cool but hard to read and maybe a little distracting. First slowing it down quite a bit is smart and maybe put on the screen instead below it since that wil help understand what is going on. Fist i slowed it down to make more readible but it still hard to read.

## What to do in the future

Make the wind sound effect beter through using the screen and try to make it more clear.

Only use the screen shake if for 1 sec for sound effect you can't see but hear. This maybe can used for an later scene where an hard knock happens and you don't see it well.

Match the sound effect beter with the sound it self that the user is more immerseved.

## Feedback

Moet herkansen. Ging ok en volgens vasilis heb een hele goede begin in de test periode maar te pasive speelde daarna. Hij wilt dat ik 6 Code pens ga maken met hoe irritant de piep geluid is en dat jammer genoeg de wind te visual is.

uiteindelijk vind Vasillis dat ik alleen echt Closed Captions heb gemaakt en niks anders.

## Test plan voor vakantie

Maak 6 code pens voor HCD piep geluid. Eerst concept en dan meer.

- Screen shake in an increasing way.
- Cube behind the screen shaking and growing larger.
- Annoying colors that gets worse over time.
- Combination of multiple to be able to make 6 code pens

Also maybe try something else with the wind figure it out Matthijs next week.kn


## retake

Ik moest minimaal 6 code pens maken met de piep geluiden na doen. Ik heb uit eindelijk 13 verschillende gemaakt. Dit 6/7 zelfde technieken met variatie en combinaties van meerdere technieken.

Deze code pens zijn bedoelt als prototypes.

Ik zou met deze prototypes wilen testen en kijken wat goed en te ver gaat. Te ver is eigelijk de goal want het geluid is best uit of nergens en verassend. Dit is ook de reden dat ik het zo ver heb door getrokken.

Ik zou afhankelijk van de test resultaten de prototypes gaan combineren en kijken wat het beste werkt. En verwijderen wat niet werkt. en dan het beste matchen met de piep geluiden.
